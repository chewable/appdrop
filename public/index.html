    <h2>Host your <a href="http://appengine.google.com">Google AppEngine</a> applications.</h2>
<p>Or you can <a href="/apps">browse the applications</a> we already host.</p>

<p><strong>Confidence builder:</strong> AppDrop is a proof-of-concept, made to show that the AppEngine platform released by Google is not closed, and could easily be supported by other hosts. Unlike Google&apos;s project, we make no claims to be able to scale beyond a small amount of traffic. In fact, at AppDrop we reserve the right to shut the whole thing down any time we feel like it. We're running on EC2, so <em>our virtual machine could just disappear at any time</em>. We hope you enjoy AppDrop. If we see enough demand, we might decided to make serious go at it. Only time will tell.</p>
<h2><em>Lock in, we don&apos;t need no stinking lock in!</em></h2>
<p><strong>Use at your own risk!</strong> Our current implementation makes no claims to be a finished product. For that reason, we&apos;re doing the simplest thing that could possibly work on most fronts. This means that we&apos;ve pretty much ignored security concerns, so for the time being please don&apos;t upload any applications that deal in sensitive data. Also, we&apos;ve yet to enable email support. This application and the EC2 Image that support it will be released for you to play with soon enough, so if email support, database scaling, or more secure logins are important to you, you&apos;ll have the opportunity to implement them yourself.</p>
