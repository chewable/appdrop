    <h2>Host your <a href="http://appengine.google.com">Google AppEngine</a> applications.</h2>
<p>Or you can <a href="/apps">browse the applications</a> we already host.</p>

<p><strong>Confidence builder:</strong> AppDrop is a proof-of-concept, made to show that the AppEngine platform released by Google is not closed, and could easily be supported by other hosts. Unlike Google&apos;s project, we make no claims to be able to scale beyond a small amount of traffic. In fact, at AppDrop we reserve the right to shut the whole thing down any time we feel like it. We're running on EC2, so <em>our virtual machine could just disappear at any time</em>. We hope you enjoy AppDrop. If we see enough demand, we might decided to make serious go at it. Only time will tell.</p>
