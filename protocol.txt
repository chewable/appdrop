basic process: 

fug-this links to google login page, user sumbits login form to google url. 
google submit url redirects to login service on fug-this, with a long auth key. 
*the fug-this login service presumably does a background call to goole to get the user info with which to set the cookies.*
on the setting-cookie response, the fug-this service also redirects to the continue url.


in dev mode

fug this links to the login page on its own domain, which sets the cookie (unauthenticated) on submit and redirects back to the continue url...


MY INSECURE AUTH PROTOCOL

login link (or maybe it is easier to leave this alone and set the current version of it (_ah/login) to redirect to appdrop.com/login)?

http://appdrop.com/login?continue=http://myapp.appdrop.com/_ah/login%3Fcontinue%3Dhttp://myapp.appdrop.com/

draws form that submits to 

http://appdrop.com/login or http://appdrop.com/authorize with continue as a hidden field

the form reciever redirects to 

http://myapp.appdrop.com/_ah/login?continue=http://myapp.appdrop.com/&auth=878this7is23my37expiring2unique4token


which only has to query appdrop with that auth token to get the user info {email, nickname} 

http://appdrop.com/token?auth=878this7is23my37expiring2unique4token

which it uses to set the session cookie (this cookie needs to be tamperproof like rails, and feed into the User() service to work with the google-style API).

logout link
http://myapp.appdrop.com/_ah/logout?continue=http://myapp.appdrop.com/
this is simple all it does is clear the session cookie.
